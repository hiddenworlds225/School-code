Hello World Beginning Project.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The current project does not have any use, other than to put text on a screen.

This is a good starting point though, as it allows the user to understand how to 
send information back to the user.

I would say that println is far more useful than just print, but print has its own 
uses as well.

Also, the print feature doesn't stray too far from the python version.
